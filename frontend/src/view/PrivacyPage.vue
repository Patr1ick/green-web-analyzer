        This privacy policy provides an overview of the data that is collected, stored and, if necessary, processed.
        The
        data protection declaration only applies to this page ("green-web-analyzer.eu"). I, the operator of the
        site,
        believe that data protection should be a universal right of everyone, therefore as little data as possible
        is
        stored. By using the tool, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this
        Privacy
        Policy.
        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-1 mt-4">Data that is being collected</h2>
        <h3 class="text-lg mb-1 mt-4">Personal Data</h3>
        The usage of this website is possible without the disclosure of personal data.
        <h3 class="text-lg mb-1 mt-4">Usage Data</h3>
        By requesting a report the following data is automatically submitted and logged:
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
            <li>IP address of the person requesting the report</li>
            <li>Date and Time of the request</li>
            <li>The specified URL which is needed to create the report</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="text-lg mb-1 mt-4">Cookies and other</h3>
        This website does not use any cookies or other tracking technologies.
        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-1 mt-4">Personal data that is being disclosed</h2>
        No data will be passed on to third parties.
        <h2 class="text-2xl mb-1 mt-4">Changes to the privacy policy</h2>
        I reserve the right to adapt this data protection declaration so that it always reflects the current
        status of data storage, processing and transfer. The new data protection statement will then apply to
        your next visit.
